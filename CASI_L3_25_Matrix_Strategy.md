5 Practical Teaching Skills × 5 QuickRide Phases

Trainer ↔ Instructor Role Switching Guide

**Section 1: Framework Overview**

**What the L3 Exam Really Tests**

The CASI L3 Teaching Exam tests your ability to integrate teaching
skills INTO riding progression --- not to discuss them separately.

> *\"QuickRide = WHAT to teach. Teaching Skills = HOW to teach. The exam
> tests whether you can combine both seamlessly.\"*

  -------- ----------------------- --------------------------------------

**Section 2: 25-Combination Matrix**

**Phase 1: BASICS --- Equipment + Mobility**

**#1 BASICS × Guest Service & Safety**

**Focus:** 建立信任 + 安全环境 Building Trust & Safe Environment

**Trainer Goal:** Train instructors to manage first-time rider anxiety
and create psychological safety before any physical skills are
introduced.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Equipment orientation (board parts,
bindings, stance); terrain selection (flat, isolated area); fall-safe
drills (how to fall safely heel-side and toe-side); establish group
agreements on spacing.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"At the basics stage, safety builds confidence, which allows
> mobility development.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Rushing into skating without addressing fear;
ignoring individual anxiety levels.

**Trainer Tip:** Ask instructors: \'How do you know when a student feels
safe enough to move on?\'

**#2 BASICS × Communication & Lesson Structure**

**Focus:** 解释装备与基本站姿 Explaining Equipment & Neutral Stance

**Trainer Goal:** Develop instructors\' ability to use What-Why-How
framework for explaining basic concepts clearly.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Explain neutral stance using simple
language → Demo → Student trial → Immediate feedback loop. Break
equipment intro into: board, bindings, boots (3B method).

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Clear communication at basics stage prevents bad habits from
> forming.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Over-explaining technical details; using jargon with
beginners.

**Trainer Tip:** Have instructors practice a 30-second equipment
explanation --- concise, no jargon.

**#3 BASICS × Demonstrations**

**Focus:** 视觉清晰度 Visual Clarity for Beginners

**Trainer Goal:** Train instructors to deliver exaggerated, slow-speed
demonstrations that first-timers can actually process.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Exaggerated neutral stance demo (side
view + front view); slow skating demonstration; use freeze-frame
technique at key positions.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Beginners need slower, larger movements --- subtlety is invisible
> to them.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Demonstrating at normal speed; showing from only one
angle.

**Trainer Tip:** Ask: \'What did you see?\' after each demo to check
student comprehension.

**#4 BASICS × Analysis & Improvement**

**Focus:** 识别恐惧与站姿问题 Identifying Fear & Stance Issues

**Trainer Goal:** Help instructors distinguish between fear-based
movement patterns and genuine technical errors.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Observation checklist: heel-heavy
stance, upper body tension, locked knees, looking down. Use cause-based
analysis: is it fear or misunderstanding?

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"At basics, most \'errors\' are actually fear responses --- address
> the cause, not the symptom.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Giving technical corrections for fear-based issues;
over-correcting too early.

**Trainer Tip:** Outcome vs. Cause: stiff arms (outcome) may come from
fear of falling (cause).

**#5 BASICS × Technical Content**

**Focus:** 板面构造与重心定位 Board Parts & COM Positioning

**Trainer Goal:** Ensure instructors can explain foundational technical
concepts without overwhelming beginners.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Board anatomy (nose, tail, edges, base);
COM over the board center; neutral stance biomechanics (athletic
position). Use tactile exercises: feel the edges, rock toe-to-heel.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Technical content at basics = only what\'s needed for the first
> run.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Teaching edge angles or pressure theory too early;
information overload.

**Trainer Tip:** If a beginner can\'t use it in the next 5 minutes,
don\'t teach it yet.

**Phase 2: SLIDING --- Comfort Sliding**

**#6 SLIDING × Guest Service & Safety**

**Focus:** 管理滑行焦虑 Managing Speed Anxiety

**Trainer Goal:** Train instructors to create progressive speed exposure
that builds confidence without overwhelming students.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Toe/heel drag speed control drills; use
terrain gradient to manage speed naturally; confidence-building
progression from very gentle slope to slightly steeper.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Speed anxiety is the #1 barrier at sliding stage --- manage it
> proactively.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Choosing terrain that\'s too steep; not providing a
speed control tool before sliding.

**Trainer Tip:** Always give students a \'brake\' (drag/sideslip) before
asking them to slide.

**#7 SLIDING × Communication & Lesson Structure**

**Focus:** 解释滑行与推行的区别 Explaining Glide vs Push

**Trainer Goal:** Develop instructors\' ability to break sliding into
micro-skills with clear progressions.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Progression: stationary balance → push
(skating) → short glide → longer glide. Explain each step\'s purpose
before executing. Use distance markers as goals.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Breaking sliding into micro-skills prevents cognitive overload.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Jumping from stationary to full sliding without
intermediate steps.

**Trainer Tip:** Use the mantra: \'Smaller steps = faster progress.\'

**#8 SLIDING × Demonstrations**

**Focus:** 展示直线滑行稳定性 Showing Straight Run Stability

**Trainer Goal:** Train instructors to demonstrate flat-base gliding
with clear body position reference points.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Demo: relaxed athletic stance during
straight run; show stable upper body vs unstable upper body (contrast
demo). Use student-speed demonstrations.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Demonstrate at student speed, not instructor speed.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Going too fast in demos; not showing common errors
for contrast.

**Trainer Tip:** Contrast demos (correct vs incorrect) are powerful at
this stage.

**#9 SLIDING × Analysis & Improvement**

**Focus:** 分析防御姿态与过度转体 Analyzing Defensive Posture &
Over-Rotation

**Trainer Goal:** Help instructors identify and correct the two most
common sliding-stage errors.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Observation focus: defensive posture
(leaning back, arms up, head down) and counter-rotation. Corrective
approach: address the root cause (fear → defensive; misunderstanding →
rotation).

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"At sliding stage, fix the fear first, then the technique.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Telling students to \'relax\' without giving them a
reason to feel safe.

**Trainer Tip:** Use video or follow-behind observation --- students
don\'t know what they look like.

**#10 SLIDING × Technical Content**

**Focus:** 平底平衡与重心对齐 Flat Base Balance & COM Alignment

**Trainer Goal:** Ensure instructors understand and can teach the
biomechanics of balanced sliding.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Flat base concept (even pressure
distribution); COM alignment over the center of the board; fore-aft
balance drills (reach for nose, reach for tail).

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Flat base = the foundation of all future edge control.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Ignoring fore-aft imbalance; only focusing on
lateral balance.

**Trainer Tip:** Ask students to feel even pressure on both feet ---
proprioceptive feedback.

**Phase 3: CONTROL --- Speed + Direction Control**

**#11 CONTROL × Guest Service & Safety**

**Focus:** 速度管理即安全 Speed Management = Safety

**Trainer Goal:** Train instructors to teach speed control as a safety
skill, not just a technical one.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Sideslip as the primary speed management
tool; terrain selection for safe practice; stopping drills (both edges).
Emphasize: control = confidence = safety.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Speed management is the bridge between safety and technical
> development.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Teaching speed control on terrain that\'s too flat
(no challenge) or too steep (too much fear).

**Trainer Tip:** Frame speed control as empowerment: \'You decide how
fast you go.\'

**#12 CONTROL × Communication & Lesson Structure**

**Focus:** 解释刃角概念递进 Explaining Edging Concept Progression

**Trainer Goal:** Develop instructors\' ability to build edging concepts
progressively from sideslip to pendulum.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Progression: sideslip (flat to edge) →
falling leaf (directional sideslip) → pendulum (edge to edge). Each step
builds on the previous; explain WHY before HOW.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Edging is not one skill --- it\'s a progression of related
> skills.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Skipping falling leaf and jumping straight to turns.

**Trainer Tip:** Each step should feel like a small upgrade, not a big
leap.

**#13 CONTROL × Demonstrations**

**Focus:** 清晰的钟摆刃角控制演示 Clear Pendulum Edge Control Demo

**Trainer Goal:** Train instructors to demonstrate edging mechanics with
clear, repeatable visual cues.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Pendulum demo: slow, exaggerated
edge-to-edge transitions. Show the body position at each phase. Use
terrain features as reference points. Demo both heel-side and toe-side
entry.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"A good demo at control stage shows the process, not just the
> result.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Demonstrating too quickly; not breaking down the
transition moment.

**Trainer Tip:** Freeze at the edge-change moment --- that\'s what
students need to see most.

**#14 CONTROL × Analysis & Improvement**

**Focus:** 刃角释放时机分析 Edge Release Timing Analysis

**Trainer Goal:** Help instructors observe and correct timing issues in
edge-to-flat-to-edge transitions.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Common timing issues: too early release
(loss of control), too late release (stuck on edge). Observation cues:
watch the base of the board, not the rider\'s upper body. Use cause
analysis: why is the timing off?

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Edge release timing is where control becomes turning --- it\'s the
> critical transition.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Focusing on body position instead of board behavior
during analysis.

**Trainer Tip:** Watch the board first, then trace the cause up to the
body.

**#15 CONTROL × Technical Content**

**Focus:** 压力与刃角的关系 Pressure & Edging Relationship

**Trainer Goal:** Ensure instructors can explain the interdependence of
pressure and edge angle.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Technical content: pressure distribution
affects edge grip; edge angle affects turn radius. Hands-on exercises:
press into the edge (feel grip change); vary edge angle while
sideslipping.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Pressure without edge = sliding. Edge without pressure =
> chattering. You need both.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Teaching pressure and edging as separate concepts
instead of an integrated system.

**Trainer Tip:** Use the analogy: edge angle is the steering wheel,
pressure is the gas pedal.

**Phase 4: TURNING --- Edge Change**

**#16 TURNING × Guest Service & Safety**

**Focus:** 交通意识与路线选择 Traffic Awareness & Line Choice

**Trainer Goal:** Train instructors to integrate mountain safety
awareness into turning lessons.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Responsibility Code review relevant to
turning (uphill rider yields); line choice for linked turns (visibility,
spacing); scanning technique before initiating turns.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Turning without awareness is just controlled crashing.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Teaching turn technique without any mountain
awareness context.

**Trainer Tip:** Build scanning habits early --- they\'re much harder to
add later.

**#17 TURNING × Communication & Lesson Structure**

**Focus:** 解释换刃序列 Explaining Edge Change Sequence

**Trainer Goal:** Develop instructors\' ability to communicate the
multi-phase process of a linked turn.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Turn phases: completion → transition
(edge release) → initiation (new edge engagement). Use numbered sequence
or rhythm cues. Keep language consistent throughout the lesson.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Students need a mental model of the turn before they can execute it
> physically.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Using different terminology for the same phase;
inconsistent language.

**Trainer Tip:** Pick ONE set of turn phase words and stick with them
all lesson.

**#18 TURNING × Demonstrations**

**Focus:** 连贯初学转弯清晰演示 Linked Beginner Turns Clarity

**Trainer Goal:** Train instructors to demonstrate beginner-appropriate
linked turns with visible technique.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Demo linked beginner turns (wider,
slower, more visible edge change). Show from multiple angles. Use
follow-me format so students can see the turn shape from behind.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Demo turns should match the student\'s target skill level, not the
> instructor\'s ability.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Demonstrating expert-level carved turns to
beginners.

**Trainer Tip:** If your demo is better than what you\'re asking them to
do, it\'s too advanced.

**#19 TURNING × Analysis & Improvement**

**Focus:** 转弯启动原因分析 Turn Initiation Cause Analysis

**Trainer Goal:** Help instructors identify what is causing (or
preventing) successful turn initiation.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Cause analysis framework: Is the turn
initiated by rotation, pressure shift, or edge release? Common issues:
counter-rotation as primary initiator (band-aid), no flat base phase,
rushing the transition.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Analyze what starts the turn --- that reveals the student\'s
> movement pattern.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Focusing only on the turn shape (outcome) instead of
what initiates it (cause).

**Trainer Tip:** Watch the first 1/3 of the turn --- that\'s where the
technique lives.

**#20 TURNING × Technical Content**

**Focus:** 旋转与刃角的配比 Rotational vs Edging Blend

**Trainer Goal:** Ensure instructors understand the spectrum from
rotary-dominant to edge-dominant turns.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Technical content: beginner turns use
more rotation, advanced turns use more edging. Demonstrate the spectrum.
Explain that both are valid --- the blend changes with terrain and
ability.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"There\'s no wrong blend --- just a blend that matches (or doesn\'t
> match) the student\'s level and terrain.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Telling beginners to stop rotating entirely;
eliminating rotation too early.

**Trainer Tip:** The goal is to add edging skills, not to remove
rotation skills.

**Phase 5: FLOW --- Mountain Exploration**

**#21 FLOW × Guest Service & Safety**

**Focus:** 地形管理与速度选择 Terrain Management & Speed Choice

**Trainer Goal:** Train instructors to teach autonomous mountain
navigation as the final safety milestone.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Terrain reading skills: slope angle,
snow conditions, traffic patterns. Speed choice based on conditions.
Self-assessment questions students can use independently.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Flow stage safety = the student can make their own safe
> decisions.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Still micro-managing terrain choice at flow stage
instead of empowering the student.

**Trainer Tip:** Ask: \'Where would you go next and why?\' --- test
their decision-making.

**#22 FLOW × Communication & Lesson Structure**

**Focus:** 学员自主性 Student Autonomy & Self-Direction

**Trainer Goal:** Develop instructors\' ability to shift from directing
to facilitating at the flow stage.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Guided discovery: ask questions instead
of giving answers. Let students choose terrain, speed, turn shape.
Instructor provides framework, student fills in the details.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"At flow stage, the best instruction is the least instruction.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Over-coaching at flow stage; not letting go of
control.

**Trainer Tip:** If you\'re talking more than the student is riding,
you\'re doing too much.

**#23 FLOW × Demonstrations**

**Focus:** 流畅连接转弯演示 Fluid Linking Turns Demo

**Trainer Goal:** Train instructors to demonstrate flowing, rhythmic
linked turns as inspiration for student development.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Demo: rhythmic, flowing linked turns on
varied terrain. Show turn shape variety (short, medium, long radius).
Use follow-me and lead-follow formats.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"At flow stage, demos inspire rather than instruct.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Still using beginner-speed demos at flow stage; not
challenging the student visually.

**Trainer Tip:** Match your demo to slightly above the student\'s
current ability --- aspirational but achievable.

**#24 FLOW × Analysis & Improvement**

**Focus:** 弯形与地形适应分析 Turn Shape & Terrain Adaptation Analysis

**Trainer Goal:** Help instructors analyze how well students adapt their
technique to changing conditions.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Observation focus: does the student vary
turn shape with terrain? Do they adjust speed for conditions? Feedback
focus: tactical decision-making, not just execution.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Flow stage analysis shifts from \'how do you turn\' to \'why did
> you choose that turn.\'\"*

**Common Mistake:** Still analyzing basic technique instead of tactical
decisions.

**Trainer Tip:** Ask \'why did you choose that line?\' --- the answer
reveals their thinking.

**#25 FLOW × Technical Content**

**Focus:** 重心释放与屈伸时机 COM Release & Flexion/Extension Timing

**Trainer Goal:** Ensure instructors can teach advanced movement timing
for smooth, efficient riding.

**Instructor Lesson Strategy:** Technical content: flexion into turn
completion → extension through transition → flexion into new turn.
Rhythm and timing exercises. Use terrain features to practice timing.

**Key Line (Exam Use):**

> *\"Flexion-extension timing is what separates controlled turns from
> flowing turns.\"*

**Common Mistake:** Teaching flexion-extension as a mechanical drill
instead of a rhythm.

**Trainer Tip:** Use music or counting rhythm to help students feel the
timing, not think about it.

**Section 3: Trainer ↔ Instructor Role Switching**

This is the most commonly failed aspect of the L3 Teaching Exam. You
MUST clearly distinguish between two roles and announce transitions
explicitly.

  -------------- ---------------------------- ----------------------------
                 **TRAINER Role**             **INSTRUCTOR Role**

  **When**       Introduction & Wrap Up       Sample Lesson Delivery

  **Focus**      Teaching skill development   Student riding improvement
                 Instructor learning          Real teaching moment Skill
                 Meta-teaching                execution

  **Audience**   Fellow instructors (peers)   Students (riders)

  **Language**   \"As instructors, how could  \"Today we are working on
                 you apply this\...\"         controlling speed\...\"

  **Goal**       Develop the instructor\'s    Improve the student\'s
                 teaching ability             riding ability
  -------------- ---------------------------- ----------------------------

**Exam Role Switch Template (Memorize This)**

**Step 1 --- Trainer Introduction**

> **Script:** *\"Today we will explore how \[TEACHING SKILL\] can
> support learning in the \[QUICKRIDE PHASE\] phase.\"*
>
> **Notes:** Set the meta-teaching context. Identify what teaching skill
> you\'ll focus on and why it matters at this stage.

**Step 2 --- Transition Statement (CRITICAL)**

> **Script:** *\"Now I will switch roles and demonstrate how I would
> deliver this in a student lesson.\"*
>
> **Notes:** This statement MUST be explicit. The examiner needs to hear
> you clearly announce the role change.

**Step 3 --- Instructor Sample Lesson**

> **Script:** *\"\[Deliver a realistic lesson segment: introduce skill,
> demo, practice, feedback\]\"*
>
> **Notes:** This should feel like a real lesson. Include terrain
> choice, student profile, and a training cycle (intro → demo → practice
> → feedback).

**Step 4 --- Transition Back**

> **Script:** *\"Switching back to my trainer role now\...\"*
>
> **Notes:** Again, must be explicit. Don\'t just drift back ---
> announce it.

**Step 5 --- Trainer Wrap Up**

> **Script:** *\"So as instructors, what we demonstrated there was
> \[TEACHING SKILL\] applied to \[PHASE\]. How could you adapt this for
> a different student profile?\"*
>
> **Notes:** Reflect on the teaching skill usage. Connect to broader
> instructor development. Invite discussion.

**Section 4: Top Exam Failure Points**

**#1 Staying in Trainer talk the entire time**

> **Fix:** You MUST deliver a real sample lesson (Instructor role).
> Trainer-only presentations fail.

**#2 Sample lesson feels fake or rehearsed**

> **Fix:** Treat your peers as real students. Use real terrain
> references. Include realistic feedback moments.

**#3 No clear role transition announcement**

> **Fix:** Use explicit transition statements. The examiner needs to
> hear the switch.

**#4 Teaching skill disconnected from riding phase**

> **Fix:** Every teaching action must connect to the student\'s riding
> development at that specific phase.

**#5 Over-teaching technical content at early stages**

> **Fix:** Match technical depth to the phase. Basics/Sliding = minimal
> theory. Flow = more tactical discussion.

**#6 No cause-based analysis**

> **Fix:** Always ask WHY before correcting WHAT. Outcome analysis is
> L2. Cause analysis is L3.

**Section 5: Distinction-Level Strategies**

To score at the highest level, integrate these three concepts into every
combination:

**★ Student-Centered Learning**

> Every decision (terrain, pace, feedback, demo style) should be
> justified by the student\'s needs, not the curriculum. Ask yourself:
> \'Why this, for THIS student, at THIS moment?\'

**★ Tactical Justification**

> Don\'t just say what you\'d do --- explain why. \'I chose a falling
> leaf exercise because this student needs to feel edge control before
> attempting a full turn.\' Every tactic needs a reason.

**★ Cause vs. Outcome Analysis**

> L2 says \'the student is leaning back.\' L3 says \'the student is
> leaning back because they fear the fall line, so we need to build
> trust in their speed control before addressing posture.\' Always trace
> the cause.
