AI & Flow

ski resort got complaints that many adults keptnon asking questions
what can we do to clarify their confusion?
what: apply ai when we teach
why: ai could be a good tool to analysis their issues and give them specific and tactical feedbacks to help students progress.
how: proper vantage points, looking above(time of edge change)/passby(body movements)/below(snow spreading), 
demo lesson 
add traverse in beginner turns, bending lower body joints, how to better feel the edge and pressure on snow
1. demo, students riding down, looking from below, give feedbacks
2. demo, stop half way, ask students to riding pass, stop at a point, give feedbacks
3. ask 1st student to lead the way, following them at back, give feedbacks

conclusion: 
in the demo lesson, from which vantage points did i analyze the students
what if i only analyze from only one point? what could be the downside
why the feedbacks using ai tool could be more effective than just correcting the outcomes? 

seems the adults could have less confusion and improve progressively based on the specific and tactical feedbacks.

today is a bit of slushy, so let's be careful the snow condition can change a lot from morning to afternoon
