**Section 1: Trainer ↔ Instructor Role Switching**

This is the #1 reason candidates fail the L3 Teaching Exam. You must
clearly distinguish between your Trainer role (meta-teaching about
teaching) and your Instructor role (delivering a real lesson).
Transitions must be announced explicitly.

**Section 2: BASICS Phase --- Equipment + Mobility**

**#1 BASICS × Guest Service & Safety**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Today we\'re focusing on how guest service and safety support learning
> in the basics phase. When students first arrive, they\'re often
> anxious about equipment, falling, and the unfamiliar environment. If
> we don\'t address that anxiety first, no technical instruction will
> land. Our job as instructors is to create psychological safety before
> we ask for physical risk. The teaching skill here is reading emotional
> readiness and building trust through intentional environment design.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"I\'ll now switch into instructor role and show how
this looks in a real lesson.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> Welcome everyone! My name is \[Name\], I\'ll be your instructor today.
> Before we touch any equipment, let\'s get comfortable. Has anyone been
> on snow before? \[Listen\] Great --- today\'s goal is simply to feel
> confident standing and moving with a board. No pressure to go fast.
>
> Let\'s start with our equipment. \[Walk through board parts: nose,
> tail, edges, bindings\]. I\'ll show you how to step in safely. Watch
> me first. \[Demo entry\]. Now you try --- take your time.
>
> Before we move, let\'s practice falling safely. Knees drop first, then
> hands. Like this. \[Demo heel-side fall, then toe-side\]. Everyone try
> twice each side.
>
> Now let\'s try skating on this flat area. I chose this spot because
> it\'s flat, away from traffic, and gives you room to explore.
> Push-push-glide. I\'ll go first. \[Demo at student speed\].

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> Switching back to trainer role. Notice what happened there --- I
> addressed anxiety before introducing any skills. The terrain choice,
> the fall practice, the pacing --- all designed to build trust. As
> instructors, ask yourself: can your students take a physical risk if
> they don\'t feel emotionally safe? How would you adapt this for a
> group with mixed anxiety levels?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If a student refuses to move → the cause is
likely fear, not lack of understanding. Address the emotion, not the
technique.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Examiners want to see that you prioritize emotional
readiness. Don\'t rush past introductions.

**#2 BASICS × Communication & Lesson Structure**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Today we\'ll explore how clear communication and structured lesson
> flow support learning at the basics stage. New riders process
> information slowly --- they\'re managing fear, new equipment, and
> unfamiliar sensations simultaneously. If our communication is unclear
> or our lesson jumps around, we add cognitive overload to an already
> overwhelmed learner. The key teaching skill is using the What-Why-How
> framework and keeping language simple, consistent, and sequenced.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"I\'ll now switch to instructor role to demonstrate
this in a lesson.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> Alright team, our goal today is to feel balanced and comfortable
> standing on the board. Here\'s our plan: first I\'ll explain the
> position, then I\'ll show you, then you try, and I\'ll give you
> feedback. Simple.
>
> WHAT: We\'re learning neutral stance --- a relaxed, athletic position
> on the board. WHY: This is your home base. Every movement starts and
> ends here. HOW: Soft knees, weight centered between both feet, arms
> relaxed at your sides, eyes forward.
>
> \[Demo neutral stance --- front view, side view, hold 3 seconds each\]
>
> Now everyone find that position. Soft knees\... weight centered\...
> eyes up. \[Walk through group, give individual feedback\]. Great ---
> Sarah, try dropping your hips just a bit more. Perfect.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> Back to trainer role. The structure was: explain → demo → practice →
> feedback. That\'s a training cycle. Notice the What-Why-How kept the
> explanation under 30 seconds --- no jargon, no overload. As
> instructors, how would you modify your language for children versus
> adults at this same stage?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If students look confused after explanation → the
cause is usually too much information at once, not lack of intelligence.
Simplify and repeat.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Show the examiner you can explain complex concepts in
under 30 seconds using What-Why-How.

**#3 BASICS × Demonstrations**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> We\'re looking at how demonstrations support learning at the basics
> stage. Beginners are primarily visual learners at this point --- they
> can\'t yet feel what correct movement is, so they need to see it
> clearly. The challenge is that instructor-speed demonstrations are
> invisible to beginners. Our demos need to be slower, larger, and shown
> from multiple angles. The teaching skill is matching demo complexity
> to student processing speed.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Let me show you what this looks like in a
lesson.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> OK everyone, I\'m going to show you what we\'re aiming for. Watch my
> whole body first, don\'t focus on details yet.
>
> \[Demo neutral stance --- exaggerated, hold 5 seconds, side view\]
>
> Now watch again --- this time notice my knees. \[Demo again, front
> view, point to knees\]
>
> One more time --- watch where my weight is. Centered, right between my
> feet. \[Demo, freeze\]
>
> Now watch what it looks like when it\'s wrong. \[Demo: stiff legs,
> leaning back\]. See the difference? \[Demo correct again\]. Your turn
> --- find the good version.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> Trainer role again. Three key demo techniques there: repetition from
> multiple angles, freeze-frame at key positions, and contrast demo
> showing correct versus incorrect. The contrast is powerful because
> beginners often don\'t know what \"wrong\" looks like. How could you
> use contrast demos at later stages?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If students can\'t replicate the demo → the cause
is often demo speed or angle, not student ability. Slow down and
reposition.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Always demo at student speed. Show from at least 2
angles. Use contrast demos to highlight key points.

**#4 BASICS × Analysis & Improvement**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Today we focus on analysis and improvement at the basics stage. This
> is where L3 really separates from L2 --- at L2, we identify what\'s
> wrong. At L3, we identify why it\'s wrong. At basics, most movement
> errors are actually fear responses, not technical deficiencies. The
> teaching skill is distinguishing between emotional causes and
> technical causes, then addressing the root.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching to instructor role now.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> \[Students are practicing skating\]
>
> Let me watch everyone do one more push-push-glide. \[Observe\]
>
> I notice some of us are standing quite tall with stiff arms. That\'s
> totally normal --- your body is protecting itself because this feels
> new. Let\'s try something: everyone shake your arms out. Wiggle your
> fingers. Now bend your knees a bit and take a breath. \[Wait\] Good.
>
> Now try the push-push-glide again with that relaxed feeling. \[Observe
> improvement\]. See the difference? When we relax, our balance improves
> naturally.
>
> \[To individual\]: Mike, I see you\'re looking down at the board. That
> shifts your weight forward. Try picking a spot ahead of you and
> skating toward it. Eyes drive balance.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> Back to trainer. The analysis process was: observe behavior → identify
> possible cause → choose intervention. The stiff arms weren\'t a
> technical error --- they were a fear response. Telling students to
> \"bend their arms\" wouldn\'t fix it. The relaxation drill addressed
> the cause. This is cause-based analysis. When do you think fear-based
> versus technique-based errors become harder to distinguish?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** Outcome: stiff arms, upright posture. Cause:
anxiety/fear response. Fix: build comfort first, then refine position.
Don\'t give technical corrections for emotional problems.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** L3 examiners specifically look for cause analysis.
Always state the cause before the correction.

**#5 BASICS × Technical Content**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> We\'re examining technical content at the basics stage. The trap here
> is over-teaching. Instructors who love technical knowledge often dump
> too much theory on beginners. At basics, technical content should be
> limited to what the student needs in the next 5 minutes. Board parts,
> COM position, neutral stance --- that\'s it. The teaching skill is
> editorial restraint: knowing what NOT to teach is as important as
> knowing what to teach.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Let me demonstrate this in a lesson.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> Before we move, let\'s get to know your board. This is the nose --- it
> points downhill. This is the tail. These metal strips are your edges
> --- they\'ll become your best friends later. For now, just know
> they\'re there.
>
> Now let\'s talk about balance. Your center of mass --- think of it as
> your belly button --- needs to stay over the middle of the board.
> Watch: if I lean too far forward \[demo\], I fall. Too far back
> \[demo\], same thing. Right in the middle \[demo\] --- stable.
>
> That\'s all the theory you need right now. Let\'s go use it. \[Move to
> skating drills\]

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> Trainer role. Notice what I didn\'t teach: edge angles, pressure
> distribution, rotary mechanics. None of that helps a basics-stage
> student. The skill is knowing your content deeply enough to extract
> only what\'s relevant right now. How do you decide what technical
> content is appropriate for each stage?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If a student is overloaded → the cause is usually
too much information, not too little ability. Cut content, increase
practice time.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Show the examiner you know advanced content but choose
not to use it at this stage. That demonstrates mastery.

**Section 3: SLIDING Phase --- Comfort Sliding**

**#6 SLIDING × Guest Service & Safety**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> At the sliding stage, guest service and safety shift focus to speed
> anxiety management. Students are now moving, and speed --- even
> minimal speed --- triggers a survival response. The teaching skill is
> proactive anxiety management: giving students a speed control tool
> BEFORE asking them to slide. If they feel they can stop, they\'ll be
> willing to go.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching to instructor role.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> Great work with skating! Now we\'re going to feel what it\'s like to
> slide on snow. But first --- before we go anywhere --- I\'m going to
> give you a brake.
>
> Watch: if I drag my back foot like this \[demo toe drag\], I slow down
> and stop. Try it standing still --- just feel the drag motion.
> \[Practice stationary\]
>
> Now we\'ll use this gentle slope. See how short it is? You\'ll stop
> naturally at the bottom even without the drag. But you have the drag
> if you want it. I\'ll go first. \[Demo: push, glide, drag stop\]
>
> Who wants to try? Remember --- drag anytime you want to slow down.
> You\'re in control.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> Back to trainer. The key sequence: teach the brake → let them practice
> stationary → choose easy terrain → demo first → give them control. The
> student never felt out of control because they had a tool before they
> needed it. How would you handle a student who still won\'t go after
> this?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If a student freezes at the top → the cause is
fear of losing control. Solution: demonstrate stopping again, shorten
the run, or have them walk alongside you first.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Always teach a stopping mechanism before introducing
speed. This shows safety-first thinking.

**#7 SLIDING × Communication & Lesson Structure**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Communication at the sliding stage needs to break movement into
> micro-skills. \"Just slide down\" is too vague. Students need a clear
> sequence: push, balance, glide, stop. The teaching skill is task
> decomposition --- breaking a complex movement into digestible steps
> that each have a clear success marker.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Here\'s how I\'d deliver this.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> We\'re going to build sliding in four small steps. Each one is easy on
> its own.
>
> Step 1: Push. Just like skating --- two pushes with your back foot.
> \[Demo\] Step 2: Place. Set your back foot on the stomp pad. \[Demo,
> show foot placement\] Step 3: Balance. Stand centered, both feet on
> the board, knees soft. Hold for 3 seconds. \[Demo, freeze\] Step 4:
> Ride. Let the board carry you. Drag to stop when ready. \[Demo
> complete sequence\]
>
> Let\'s practice Step 1 and 2 together first. Don\'t worry about 3 and
> 4 yet. \[Practice\]
>
> Excellent --- now let\'s add Step 3. Push, place, balance\... hold\...
> good! Now let\'s put all four together.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> Trainer role. The micro-skill breakdown gave students four clear
> checkpoints instead of one vague task. Each step had a success marker
> they could feel. As instructors, how do you decide where to break a
> complex skill apart?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If a student can do steps 1-2 but fails at step 3
→ the cause is isolated to the balance transition. No need to re-teach
everything.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Show examiners you can sequence skills progressively.
Number your steps --- it shows structure.

**#8 SLIDING × Demonstrations**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Demonstrations at the sliding stage must show stability, not speed.
> Students are watching for \"does that look safe?\" more than \"does
> that look cool?\" The teaching skill is performing demonstrations at
> student-relevant speed with clear body position reference points. We
> also introduce contrast demonstrations to help students distinguish
> correct from incorrect.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Let me show you in a lesson.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> Watch me slide down. Don\'t focus on anything specific yet --- just
> get an overall picture. \[Demo: relaxed, slow, controlled straight
> run\]
>
> Now watch again --- this time look at my upper body. See how quiet it
> is? Shoulders level, arms relaxed, eyes forward. \[Demo again, freeze
> mid-glide\]
>
> Now here\'s what it often looks like when we\'re tense. \[Demo: stiff,
> arms out wide, looking down\]. Feel the difference? \[Demo correct
> again\]
>
> Your goal is the relaxed version. You don\'t need to be perfect ---
> just aim for quiet upper body, soft knees. Let\'s try.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> Key techniques: overall first then detail focus, freeze-frame
> mid-movement, contrast demo. The contrast is especially powerful at
> sliding stage because students can\'t feel the difference yet --- they
> need to see it externally. What other contrast demos could you use at
> this stage?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If students can describe the correct position but
can\'t do it → the cause may be that the demo was too fast to
internalize. Slow down further or use a static position before the
dynamic version.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** At least one contrast demo per lesson segment shows
depth of teaching skill.

**#9 SLIDING × Analysis & Improvement**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Analysis at the sliding stage focuses on two dominant patterns:
> defensive posture and counter-rotation. Both are extremely common and
> both have the same root cause --- the body protecting itself from a
> perceived threat. The L3 teaching skill is not just naming the error
> but tracing it back to the cause and choosing an intervention that
> addresses that cause.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Instructor role now.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> \[Students sliding, observing from bottom\]
>
> Nice work everyone! I\'m seeing some great balance. A few of us are
> riding with our arms quite high and shoulders turned uphill ---
> that\'s your body saying \"I want to see where I\'m going and I want
> to be ready to catch myself.\" Totally natural.
>
> Let\'s try this: on your next run, hold your hands on your hips. This
> forces your arms down and helps center your weight. \[Demo hands on
> hips glide\]
>
> Try that. \[Observe\]
>
> Much better! Now let your hands come off your hips naturally but keep
> that centered feeling. \[Another run\]
>
> \[Individual\]: Jess, your shoulders are twisting a lot. Try looking
> where you want to go instead of where you came from. Your shoulders
> will follow your eyes.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> Trainer role. The analysis chain: observe arms up → cause is
> fear/protection → intervention is hands-on-hips to mechanically solve
> it → then remove the constraint. I didn\'t say \"put your arms down\"
> --- that treats the outcome, not the cause. The constraint drill gives
> the body a new pattern. What other constraint drills could address
> counter-rotation?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** Outcome: arms high, counter-rotation. Cause: fear
response, wanting to see downhill. Fix: use a physical constraint (hands
on hips) to create the correct pattern, then fade the constraint.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Name the CAUSE explicitly in your analysis. \"The arms
are up because\...\" is L3 language.

**#10 SLIDING × Technical Content**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Technical content at sliding stage introduces flat base balance and
> fore-aft COM alignment. Students need to understand that the board has
> a flat position between the two edges, and that their weight position
> front-to-back affects stability. The teaching skill is making
> invisible concepts tangible through feel-based exercises rather than
> verbal explanation.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Here\'s the lesson.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> Before we slide, let\'s explore your board. Stand on flat ground,
> board perpendicular to the slope. Rock gently from toe edge to heel
> edge. \[Demo\] Feel that middle spot where the board sits flat?
> That\'s flat base --- your highway. Toe and heel edges are your exit
> ramps.
>
> Now rock forward toward your front foot\... and back toward your rear
> foot. \[Demo\] Feel how the board responds? Center is stable. Too far
> either way and you lose control.
>
> Remember these two things for sliding: flat base side to side,
> centered front to back. Let\'s take that feeling into a straight run.
> \[Slide down, stop\]. What did you feel? Where was your weight?

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> The technical content was limited to two concepts: lateral flat base
> and fore-aft center. Both were taught through feel, not lecture. At
> what stage would you start adding edge angle theory?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If a student keeps catching an edge during
straight runs → cause is likely lateral imbalance (not maintaining flat
base). The rocking drill needs more time, not more explanation.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Teach technical concepts through tactile exercises.
\"Feel this\" is better than \"think about this\" at sliding stage.

**Section 4: CONTROL Phase --- Speed + Direction Control**

**#11 CONTROL × Guest Service & Safety**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> At the control stage, safety becomes about empowering the student to
> manage their own speed. The shift from basics/sliding is that the
> instructor is no longer the primary safety net --- the student is
> developing their own tools. Guest service here means framing speed
> control as freedom, not restriction. The teaching skill is terrain
> selection that challenges appropriately without overwhelming.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Instructor role.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> Today we\'re going to own our speed. You\'ll be able to go exactly as
> fast or slow as you choose. That\'s real control.
>
> We\'ll work on this slope here --- it\'s wide enough for side-to-side
> movement and steep enough to feel real speed. \[Terrain selected:
> moderate green, wide\]
>
> First: sideslip. Board across the slope, release the edge slowly and
> let yourself slide down. More edge = slower. Less edge = faster.
> You\'re the gas pedal and the brake. \[Demo heel-side sideslip\]
>
> Practice controlling your speed: go, slow down, go, stop. \[Students
> practice\]
>
> Now let\'s try the same thing on your toe side. \[Demo and practice\]
>
> You just learned to control speed on both edges. You decide how fast
> you go from now on.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> The framing was empowerment: \"you decide.\" The terrain choice gave
> them real but manageable challenge. The teaching skill was creating an
> environment where the student discovers their own control rather than
> being told what to do. How does terrain choice change the safety
> equation at this stage?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If a student can\'t control sideslip speed →
cause is usually edge angle awareness. They need more time on the
flat-to-edge rocking exercise from sliding stage.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Frame speed control positively: \"You choose your
speed\" not \"You need to slow down.\"

**#12 CONTROL × Communication & Lesson Structure**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Communication at the control stage must bridge the gap between
> concrete and abstract concepts. Edging is the first truly abstract
> idea students encounter --- they can\'t see their edge angle, they can
> only feel it. The teaching skill is using analogies, progressive
> language, and structured sequences to make the invisible visible.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Here\'s the lesson.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> We\'ve been sliding --- now we\'re going to learn to steer. Think of
> your edge like a gas pedal. Flat foot: the board slides freely. Press
> your toes or heels: the board grips and slows. The more you press, the
> more grip you get.
>
> Let me show you. \[Demo sideslip → increase edge → stop. Repeat with
> different edge amounts\]
>
> Now let\'s build this step by step: Step 1: Heel-side sideslip ---
> just control your speed. \[Practice\] Step 2: Add a direction change
> --- let the nose drift downhill, then pull it back. That\'s a falling
> leaf. \[Demo, practice\] Step 3: Bigger direction change --- pendulum
> across the slope. \[Demo, practice\]
>
> Each step adds a little more steering to your speed control. You
> already have the foundation.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> The gas pedal analogy made an abstract concept concrete. The
> three-step progression built incrementally --- same skill, increasing
> range of motion. As instructors, what other analogies work for edge
> concepts?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If a student can sideslip but can\'t do falling
leaf → the directional component is the gap. They need more time on
\"nose drift\" before adding the full pendulum.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Analogies that connect to everyday experience (gas
pedal, steering wheel) show strong communication skills.

**#13 CONTROL × Demonstrations**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Demonstrations at the control stage need to reveal the process of edge
> engagement, not just the result. Students need to see the transition
> from flat base to edge and back. The teaching skill is segmented
> demonstration --- breaking a continuous movement into visible phases,
> freezing at key moments, and using exaggerated inputs that students
> can actually observe.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Instructor role.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> I\'m going to show you the pendulum in slow motion. Watch my board,
> not my body, first time through.
>
> \[Demo: slow heel-side traverse → flat base → toe-side traverse.
> FREEZE at flat base transition\]
>
> Did you see that moment in the middle? That\'s the switch point ---
> flat base --- where you change from one edge to the other. \[Demo
> again, freeze again at transition\]
>
> Now watch my body. See how I shift my hips over the board to change
> edge? \[Demo with body focus\]
>
> One more time at a slightly more natural speed. \[Demo continuous\]
>
> Your turn. Focus on finding that flat base moment in the middle.
> That\'s the key.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> Three demo passes: board focus, body focus, then natural speed. The
> freeze at the transition point highlighted the most critical moment.
> Examiners --- how does demo pacing change between control and flow
> stages?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If students can\'t replicate the edge change →
they likely can\'t find flat base in the transition. More time on the
sideslip-to-flat drill is needed.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Multiple demo passes with different observation focuses
show sophisticated demo skills.

**#14 CONTROL × Analysis & Improvement**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Analysis at the control stage is where cause-based thinking becomes
> critical. Students will show timing errors --- releasing edges too
> early or too late, rushing transitions, or using rotation to
> compensate for lack of edge control. The L3 skill is watching the
> board first to identify what\'s happening mechanically, then tracing
> up to the body to find the cause.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Let me show you this analysis process.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> \[Students practicing garlands\]
>
> Let me watch a few runs. \[Observe from below\]
>
> I\'m noticing some of us are losing speed control mid-traverse. Let\'s
> figure out why. \[To group\] Those of you who felt like you
> accelerated unexpectedly --- what happened right before that?
>
> \[Listen\] Right --- the board went flat when you didn\'t want it to.
> That means the edge released too early. The cause is usually our
> weight shifting forward during the traverse, which flattens the board.
>
> Let\'s try this: on your next garland, think about keeping pressure
> over your back foot through the traverse. That maintains edge angle.
> \[Demo: show early release vs sustained edge\]
>
> Try two runs focusing on that. \[Observe improvement\]
>
> Better! The speed is more consistent now. The edge is holding longer.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> The analysis chain: observe outcome (unexpected acceleration) →
> identify mechanical cause (premature edge release) → trace to body
> cause (forward weight shift) → provide targeted drill. I didn\'t say
> \"stop going flat\" --- I addressed why they went flat. That\'s L3
> analysis. What other body movements cause premature edge release?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** Outcome: unexpected acceleration. Mechanical
cause: early edge release. Body cause: forward weight shift. Fix: back
foot pressure awareness.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** The three-layer analysis (outcome → mechanical → body)
is the gold standard for L3.

**#15 CONTROL × Technical Content**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Technical content at the control stage introduces the pressure-edging
> relationship. Students need to understand that edge angle without
> pressure produces chatter, and pressure without edge angle produces
> sliding. They work together. The teaching skill is making this
> relationship tangible through progressive exercises, not lecture.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Here\'s the lesson approach.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> Let\'s do an experiment. Sideslip on your heel edge with very light
> pressure --- barely touching the snow. \[Demo: light pressure sideslip
> --- board chatters and skids\]
>
> Now try heavy pressure --- really push into the edge. \[Demo: strong
> pressure --- board grips firmly\]
>
> Feel the difference? Light pressure + edge = no grip. Heavy pressure +
> edge = strong grip. Your edge angle is the steering wheel. Your
> pressure is the grip.
>
> Now try this: sideslip and gradually increase pressure, then release
> it. Feel how the board responds. \[Practice\]
>
> \[Demo: vary edge angle while maintaining constant pressure, then vary
> pressure while maintaining constant edge angle\]
>
> See how both affect the board differently? Learning to blend both is
> what makes control smooth.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> The technical content was experienced, not lectured. Students felt the
> pressure-edge relationship through their feet before I named it. At
> what stage would you introduce the third fundamental --- rotation ---
> into this blend?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If a student can edge but can\'t control speed
within the edge → the cause is usually pressure management. They need
the pressure variation drill.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** \"Feel first, name second\" shows student-centered
technical teaching. Don\'t lecture --- let them discover.

**Section 5: TURNING Phase --- Edge Change**

**#16 TURNING × Guest Service & Safety**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> At the turning stage, safety expands beyond the individual to include
> mountain awareness. Students are now mobile enough to interact with
> other traffic. The teaching skill is integrating responsibility code
> and line choice into turning lessons naturally --- not as a separate
> lecture, but woven into the skill development.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Instructor role.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> Today we\'re linking turns together. Exciting! But now that we\'re
> moving across the slope, we need to be aware of other riders.
>
> Before each turn, look uphill and across the slope. \[Demo: scanning
> head movement before initiating turn\]. This takes one second and
> prevents collisions.
>
> We\'ll practice on this run. It\'s wide with good visibility. I chose
> it because you can see uphill traffic easily.
>
> Let\'s start with three linked turns. Before each turn, scan uphill.
> Scan --- turn --- scan --- turn --- scan --- turn. \[Demo at student
> speed with exaggerated scanning\]
>
> I\'ll follow behind and watch. If I call out \"check!\" --- pause and
> scan before your next turn. \[Practice runs\]
>
> Nice! Those scans are becoming natural already. That habit will serve
> you on every run for the rest of your riding life.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> Safety was built into the skill practice, not added as a separate
> topic. The \"scan-turn\" rhythm integrates awareness with technique.
> The terrain choice supported visibility. As trainers, how would you
> handle a student who consistently forgets to scan?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If a student forgets to scan → the cause is
usually task overload --- they\'re focused on the turn mechanics.
Simplify the turn (garlands instead of full turns) while building the
scanning habit.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Integrating safety into skill development (not as
separate lecture) is a distinction-level approach.

**#17 TURNING × Communication & Lesson Structure**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Communicating the edge change sequence is one of the hardest teaching
> challenges. There are multiple phases happening simultaneously, and
> students need a mental model before they can execute physically. The
> teaching skill is creating a consistent, simple vocabulary for the
> turn phases and using it throughout the entire lesson without changing
> terms.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Let me demonstrate.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> We\'re going to build a complete turn using three words: Finish ---
> Release --- Start.
>
> Finish: complete your current turn by increasing edge angle. \[Demo
> the finish phase, freeze\] Release: flatten the board to flat base.
> This is the transition. \[Demo, freeze at flat\] Start: engage the new
> edge and begin the new turn. \[Demo, freeze at engagement\]
>
> Finish --- Release --- Start. Every turn, same three words.
>
> \[Demo two linked turns calling out each phase\]
>
> Now let\'s build it. First, just practice Finish --- that\'s your
> garland. \[Practice\] Add Release --- that\'s your edge change.
> \[Practice garland to flat base\] Now add Start --- that\'s your new
> turn. \[Practice complete turn\]
>
> Finish-Release-Start. Let\'s link three turns together using these
> words. I\'ll call them out as you ride. \[Follow and call phases\]

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> Three words, used consistently, for the entire lesson. No switching
> between \"initiate\" and \"start\" or \"transition\" and \"release.\"
> Consistent vocabulary reduces cognitive load. The progressive build
> gave students each phase separately before combining. How would you
> introduce different turn phase vocabulary to more advanced students?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If a student can\'t link turns → isolate which
phase breaks down (Finish? Release? Start?) and address that specific
gap.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Pick ONE vocabulary set for turn phases and use it all
lesson. Consistency shows strong communication skills.

**#18 TURNING × Demonstrations**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Demonstrating linked turns for students at the turning stage requires
> us to match their target skill level, not showcase our own ability. If
> we demonstrate advanced carved turns, beginners see magic --- not a
> replicable model. The teaching skill is performing \"ugly\" demos that
> accurately represent the next step for the student.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Here\'s the lesson.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> I\'m going to show you what your turns should look like at this stage.
> This won\'t look like a pro --- and that\'s the point. Watch the
> speed: slow. Watch the turn shape: wide, round, controlled.
>
> \[Demo: wide, slow linked turns with visible edge change. NOT carved,
> NOT aggressive\]
>
> Now watch from behind as I go down. Notice the turn shape --- like a
> big S on the snow. \[Demo, students watch from above\]
>
> Let me show the same thing one more time, and this time I\'ll
> exaggerate the Release moment. See how I go flat in the middle? \[Demo
> with exaggerated flat base\]
>
> That flat base moment is what separates two turns from one long skid.
> Let\'s find it together. Follow behind me, match my speed and rhythm.
> \[Lead-follow exercise\]

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> The demo matched the student\'s target level. The follow-me format let
> students experience the rhythm without thinking. Lead-follow is one of
> the most powerful tools at the turning stage. Why is it important to
> NOT demonstrate your best turns to this level of student?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If students can\'t match the follow-me rhythm →
the cause is either speed (too fast) or turn shape (too tight). Widen
and slow down your lead.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Deliberately demonstrating below your ability level
shows pedagogical maturity.

**#19 TURNING × Analysis & Improvement**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Turn initiation analysis is the heart of L3 teaching. At this stage,
> students develop habitual movement patterns --- some effective, some
> compensatory. The L3 analysis skill is identifying whether a turn is
> initiated by rotation, pressure shift, edge release, or some
> combination, and whether that pattern is appropriate for the
> student\'s level. We watch the first third of the turn --- that\'s
> where the pattern reveals itself.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Instructor role.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> \[Students linking turns, observing from below\]
>
> Great progress! Let me watch one more set of three turns each.
> \[Observe carefully\]
>
> I\'m seeing something interesting. Some of you are starting your turns
> by throwing your shoulder downhill. \[Demo the counter-rotation
> initiation\]. It works --- you\'re turning --- but it creates a
> problem: your upper body ends up twisted away from the turn direction,
> which limits how much edge you can use later.
>
> Let\'s try a different approach. Instead of rotating to start the
> turn, try this: flatten the board first --- go to flat base --- then
> let the new edge engage as you shift your hips. The turn starts from
> the bottom up, not the top down.
>
> \[Demo: rotation-initiated turn (exaggerated) vs. edge-initiated
> turn\]
>
> Let\'s practice with a garland: traverse, flatten, engage new edge. No
> upper body rotation. \[Practice\]
>
> Now link two turns using that same feeling. Flatten --- engage ---
> flatten --- engage.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> The analysis identified a compensatory pattern (counter-rotation
> initiation) and traced it to its consequence (limited edge
> engagement). The correction didn\'t say \"stop rotating\" --- it gave
> an alternative movement pattern. We replaced a bad habit with a better
> one. What would you do if the student regresses to rotation under
> pressure?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** Outcome: rushed, skiddy turns. Cause: upper body
rotation as primary initiator. Consequence: twisted body position limits
edge engagement. Fix: teach bottom-up initiation through edge release.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Show the analysis chain: what you see → what causes it
→ what it prevents → how to fix it. That\'s L3.

**#20 TURNING × Technical Content**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Technical content at the turning stage introduces the rotary-edging
> spectrum. Beginners naturally use more rotation; advanced riders use
> more edging. Both are valid --- the blend should match the student\'s
> level and the terrain. The teaching skill is helping students
> understand this as a spectrum they can move along, not a binary
> choice.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Lesson time.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> Let\'s explore what makes your turns work. There are two main
> ingredients: rotation --- turning your body to steer the board --- and
> edging --- tilting the board so it carves an arc.
>
> \[Demo a rotation-heavy turn: visible body rotation, minimal edge,
> skiddy\] \[Demo an edge-heavy turn: quiet upper body, strong edge,
> carving arc\]
>
> Right now, your turns probably look more like the first one. That\'s
> perfect for where you are. The goal isn\'t to eliminate rotation ---
> it\'s to gradually add more edging to the mix.
>
> Let\'s practice: do three turns with your normal amount of rotation.
> Then three where you try to add a bit more edge tilt during the turn.
> Feel the difference?
>
> \[Practice, feedback\]
>
> Notice how adding edge makes the turn smoother and more controlled?
> Over time, you\'ll naturally shift the blend. No rush.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> The key message: rotation isn\'t wrong, it\'s where they are on the
> spectrum. Adding edging is progression, not correction. This framing
> prevents students from feeling like they\'ve been doing it wrong. How
> would you explain this spectrum to an instructor who tells beginners
> to \"stop rotating\"?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If a student\'s turns are inconsistent → check
whether they\'re using different blends turn to turn. They may need to
commit to one consistent blend before varying it.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Presenting technique as a spectrum rather than
right/wrong shows advanced understanding.

**Section 6: FLOW Phase --- Mountain Exploration**

**#21 FLOW × Guest Service & Safety**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> At the flow stage, guest service and safety culminate in student
> independence. The ultimate safety skill isn\'t following the
> instructor\'s rules --- it\'s making sound decisions autonomously. The
> teaching skill shifts to assessment: can this student make safe
> choices without you? That determines whether they\'ve truly graduated
> from the lesson.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Instructor role.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> You\'ve got great tools now. Let\'s test your decision-making. We\'ll
> ride this section together, but I want you to lead. You choose the
> line.
>
> Before each run, tell me: What\'s the terrain? What\'s the snow
> condition? How much traffic is there? How fast should we go?
>
> \[Student assesses: \"It\'s a blue run, groomed, moderate traffic,
> medium speed.\"\]
>
> Great assessment. Let\'s go. \[Ride together, observe choices\]
>
> \[After run\]: You adjusted your speed in the busy section and chose a
> wider line. That was smart decision-making. What would change if this
> was icy? If it was a black run? \[Guided discussion\]
>
> This is what independent riding looks like: read the mountain, make
> choices, adjust as you go.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> The instructor stepped back from directing to assessing. The student
> demonstrated the 4S approach: see the terrain, assess the situation,
> select the strategy, execute safely. Flow-stage safety is about
> transferring decision-making to the student. What indicators tell you
> a student is ready for independent riding?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If a student makes poor terrain choices → the
cause is usually lack of assessment framework. They need the question
checklist (terrain? conditions? traffic? speed?) practiced more.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Showing you can step back and assess independence is a
high-level teaching skill.

**#22 FLOW × Communication & Lesson Structure**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Communication at flow stage flips from instructing to facilitating.
> The instructor talks less and asks more. Lesson structure shifts from
> \"I tell you what to do\" to \"you tell me what you want to work on,
> and I guide the exploration.\" The teaching skill is guided discovery
> --- using questions to help students self-diagnose and self-correct.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Here\'s what that looks like.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> We\'ve been linking turns all morning. Let\'s take stock. What feels
> good about your riding right now? \[Listen\]
>
> What doesn\'t feel quite right yet? \[Listen --- student says \"my
> toe-side turns feel rushed\"\]
>
> Interesting. When you say \"rushed,\" what does that feel like?
> \[Listen --- \"I feel like I\'m falling into the turn\"\]
>
> OK, let\'s explore that. Take three turns and on each toe-side turn,
> try to extend the time you spend at flat base before engaging the
> edge. See if that changes the feeling. \[Practice\]
>
> How was that? \[Listen --- \"better, more controlled\"\]
>
> So the solution was in the transition, not the turn itself. You just
> diagnosed and fixed your own technique. That\'s the skill.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> I asked seven questions and gave one instruction. The student
> identified the problem, explored a solution, and evaluated the result.
> That\'s guided discovery. At flow stage, if you\'re talking more than
> the student is riding, you\'re doing too much. How do you know when to
> shift from instructing to facilitating?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If a student can\'t self-diagnose → they need
more descriptive vocabulary. Teach them to describe sensations:
\"rushed,\" \"stuck,\" \"smooth,\" \"choppy.\" That language enables
self-analysis.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Using questions instead of statements at flow stage
shows you understand learner autonomy.

**#23 FLOW × Demonstrations**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Demonstrations at the flow stage shift purpose from \"here\'s how\" to
> \"here\'s what\'s possible.\" They inspire rather than instruct. The
> teaching skill is showing varied, fluid riding that represents the
> student\'s next horizon --- slightly beyond their current ability but
> clearly achievable.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Instructor role.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> Watch me ride this section. I\'m going to show you three different
> things: short turns, medium turns, and long turns, all linked
> together. Don\'t try to copy --- just watch the rhythm change.
>
> \[Demo: varied turn shapes flowing together rhythmically\]
>
> What did you notice? \[Discussion --- rhythm, speed changes,
> smoothness\]
>
> Now I\'ll do it again, and this time, follow behind me. Match my
> rhythm when you can, but don\'t force it. \[Lead-follow\]
>
> Now your turn. Pick any combination of short, medium, and long turns.
> Create your own rhythm. \[Students ride freely\]
>
> That\'s flow --- choosing your turn shape to match the terrain and
> your mood.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> The demo was aspirational, not instructional. Follow-me let them feel
> the rhythm before thinking about it. Then free riding let them create
> their own version. At flow stage, demos should open possibilities, not
> close them. When would you stop demonstrating and just let them ride?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If a student can only ride one turn shape → the
cause is usually habit, not inability. Variety drills (alternating
short/long) break the pattern.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** \"Inspiring\" demos show you understand the flow stage
purpose differently from earlier stages.

**#24 FLOW × Analysis & Improvement**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> Analysis at flow stage shifts from technique to tactics. We\'re no
> longer asking \"how do you turn?\" --- we\'re asking \"why did you
> choose that turn?\" The teaching skill is evaluating decision-making
> quality, not just movement quality. Does the student adapt turn shape,
> speed, and line to the terrain and conditions?

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Let me show you the analysis approach.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> \[Students free-riding a varied run\]
>
> \[After the run\]: Tell me about your choices on that run. \[Listen\]
>
> I noticed you used the same turn size the whole way down --- even
> where the slope angle changed. On the steeper section, shorter turns
> would have given you more speed control. On the flat section, longer
> turns would have maintained your momentum.
>
> Let\'s try again. This time, consciously vary your turn shape: shorter
> where it\'s steep, longer where it\'s flat. \[Demo the varied approach
> on same terrain\]
>
> \[Students ride\]
>
> Much better! You shortened turns on the pitch and opened up on the
> flat. How did that feel? \[Discussion\]
>
> That\'s terrain-adaptive riding. Reading the mountain and responding
> with appropriate technique.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> The analysis was tactical, not technical. I didn\'t correct their edge
> angle or rotation --- I questioned their decision-making. At flow
> stage, the technique is mostly there. The growth area is applying it
> intelligently to the mountain. How would you analyze a student who can
> vary turn shape but chooses not to?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** Outcome: uniform turn shape on varied terrain.
Cause: lack of terrain awareness or habit (not inability). Fix: direct
attention to terrain changes, then link those to turn shape choices.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** \"Why did you choose that?\" is the defining L3
analysis question at flow stage.

**#25 FLOW × Technical Content**

**🟢 TRAINER INTRO**

> The final technical frontier at flow stage is flexion-extension timing
> --- the vertical movement that creates smooth transitions between
> turns. Students who ride with constant height look stiff. Students who
> flex and extend create rhythm, efficiency, and flow. The teaching
> skill is teaching timing as a rhythm, not a mechanical sequence.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Here\'s the lesson.\"*

**🔵 INSTRUCTOR SAMPLE LESSON**

> Your turns are linked, your speed is controlled, your lines are good.
> Let\'s add the final ingredient: rhythm.
>
> Watch my legs as I ride. \[Demo: visible flexion into turn completion,
> extension through transition, flexion into new turn\]
>
> See the up-and-down movement? I get low at the end of each turn, tall
> during the transition, then low again in the new turn. Low --- tall
> --- low --- tall.
>
> \[Demo again, students watch from the side\]
>
> Let\'s feel it standing still. Bend --- stand --- bend --- stand.
> \[Rhythm exercise, 1-2-1-2 count\]
>
> Now let\'s add it to traverses. Flex as you press the edge, extend as
> you flatten. \[Traverse drills\]
>
> Now link it into turns. Low into the finish, tall through the release,
> low into the start. Use the rhythm you just felt. \[Practice\]
>
> \[After practice\]: Feel different? Smoother? That rhythm is what
> turns controlled riding into flowing riding.

**⟶ ROLE SWITCH:** *\"Switching back to trainer role.\"*

**🟢 TRAINER WRAP UP**

> The technical content was taught as a rhythm and a feeling, not as
> biomechanics lecture. Static exercise → traverse → turns: progressive
> integration. At what point would you introduce more specific timing
> adjustments like early vs. late extension?

**⚡ CAUSE ANALYSIS:** If a student rides with constant height → the
cause is usually not knowing the movement exists. Once they feel it,
most can replicate it. The rhythm exercise makes it tangible.

**💡 EXAM TIP:** Teaching movement as rhythm (\"low-tall-low\") rather
than mechanics (\"flex your knees 30 degrees\") is flow-stage
appropriate.

**Section 7: Exam Quick Reference**

**6 Most Common Failure Points**

**1. Staying in trainer role the whole time**

> **Fix:** You MUST deliver a real sample lesson in instructor role

**2. No explicit role transition**

> **Fix:** Say the transition out loud --- examiners need to hear it

**3. Sample lesson feels fake**

> **Fix:** Treat peers as real students with real terrain and real
> feedback

**4. Teaching skill disconnected from phase**

> **Fix:** Every tactic must connect to the student\'s riding stage

**5. Only outcome analysis (L2 level)**

> **Fix:** Always state the CAUSE: \'The arms are up BECAUSE\...\'

**6. Over-teaching at early stages**

> **Fix:** If students can\'t use it in 5 minutes, don\'t teach it yet

**3 Distinction-Level Strategies**

**★ Student-Centered Learning**

> Every decision should be justified by the student\'s needs. \'Why
> this, for THIS student, at THIS moment?\'

**★ Tactical Justification**

> Don\'t just say what --- explain why. \'I chose this drill because the
> student needs X before attempting Y.\'

**★ Cause vs. Outcome**

> L2: \'The student is leaning back.\' L3: \'The student is leaning back
> BECAUSE they fear the fall line, so we address the fear first.\'

**The Core Formula**

**QuickRide (WHAT to teach) + Teaching Skills (HOW to teach) = L3
Competency**

Master the 5-step role switch template. Fill in any of the 25
combinations.

**That\'s the entire exam.**
