太好了 👍
**Scenario 型 Anki 是 L3 Teaching exam 最接近真实考试的训练方式**。
这种卡片不是考知识点，而是训练你：

👉 看到题目 → 10秒内搭课结构
👉 自动切换 Trainer / Instructor 思维
👉 自动输出 tactical justification

---

# ✅ 使用方式（重要）

每张卡你看到正面时要：

1️⃣ 先口述 Trainer intro
2️⃣ 再口述 Instructor lesson outline
3️⃣ 最后口述 Trainer wrap

建议：
👉 每张卡练 2–3 分钟口语
👉 录音回放（L3 非常有效）
